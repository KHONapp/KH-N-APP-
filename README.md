# KHON-APP

  
  **Khôn** is a smart app that utilizes the power of AI and blockchain technology to create the perfect companion that can be used by everybody from both the web2 and web3 ecosystems. **Khôn** provides a wide range of functionalities, from in-app minigames, personality & visual customisation, virtual interactions and communications to potentially evolve into a real assistant that can provide solutions/suggestions to a number of real life tasks. An ALL-in-ONE super companion.

The special thing about **Khôn** is each AI companion is different and evolvable. Customization of individual companions can be upgraded through DLC, Events and Progress Checkpoints. Each one of them will have their own randomly assigned personality which could include traits like sassiness, grumpiness, extroversion, introversion and so on. A new and innovative way to bring AI closer to human experience. Users can learn more about their own companion by using the ability and needs chart which will include strengths and weaknesses along with hunger, play and social meters. Users can choose to interact with their companion in their own ways. For example: a companion that is sassy and fashionable will respond better to being complimented and asked about topics regarding fashion. *Equipping stylish items will potentially help boost the speed the companion grows and bonds with the user significantly. *Early Concept.

The more time spent and activities completed with each companion in **Khôn** will support the speed and strength each companion will grow, much like the way people train their pets in real life. These are represented by their Needs which can be viewed by checking their respective meters and will include: When the companion is hungry, it must be fed and when the food runs out there will be a responsibility to purchase more. When the companion is bored, it must be played and interacted with. The key point of Khôn in this regard is the AI. Users can communicate with the companions by telling stories or asking questions and so on (by audio or text TBD). Nurturing each companions' needs will be vital to the expansion of their overall functionality.

With the time spent with each companion, users will see significant changes in their characters’ through the reward system. **Khôn** has 4 stages of evolution and each stage will be unlocked when users meet a certain checkpoint. The evolution of **Khôn** is a unique point of the project, now your companion can grow up with you, moving from one stage to the next one with your care and interactions. On top of that, the AI can now answer harder and more complex questions, better jokes, memory and so on. New outfits will be unlocked and new traits added or replaced. Each of these aspects will work together to build truly unique companions which will increase their rarity (metadata update) if users wish to trade the NFT.
